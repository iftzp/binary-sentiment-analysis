    "We use the movie review polarity data set of Pang and Lee 2004 [A Sentimental Education: Sentiment Analysis Using Subjectivity Summarization Based on Minimum Cuts](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P04-1035/) in Version 2.0 available from http://www.cs.cornell.edu/People/pabo/movie-review-data (section \"Sentiment polarity datasets\"). This dataset contains 1000 positive and 1000 negative reviews, each tokenised, sentence-split (one sentence per line) and lowercased. Each review has been assigned to 1 of 10 cross-validation folds by the authors and this setup should be followed to compare with published results.\n"
